# Unity2D_DungeonGame

I started to write a game that is in Unity, where you are playing as someone stuck in a castle, the end goal of this game is to make it out of the castle alive or die trying. I want this game to be a survival game where it gets increasinly more difficult the longer the game goes on and the longer you are stuck in the castle. Each level spawns with an intial amount of enemies currently but they will also be spawn points enemies spawn from, the rate they are spawned depends on the timer.

The basic controls are wasd for player movement. The user can use space to swing your weapon. The player can also currently interact with a chest by walking on it to get gold from the chest. The gold the player has earned is saved through a save state everytime the player goes to another level. There is a camera script that controls what the camera will do. The camera is set to only follow the player around as the player moves through the castle, it is a locked camera. The enemies in this game have basic following commands and will attack you if you get too close to them. There is a timer that starts once you start the game, but it has not been fully implemented correctly.

The goal of writing this software was to improve my understanding of working with objects and inheritance. I also thought that a fun way to learn more about it was to learn Unity something I have not previously used before. Making a game that I enjoy has made learning a better experience than it would have been otherwise and that is why I want to finish the game, this is only the intial part of my game software. For this software I had to learn Unity and the Unity libraries for C# so I found a video demo I have been following that shows all the basics of Unity and C#. My goal is to learn as much as I can from the tutorial and step away from the tutorial to make the true survival game that I want to make, the tutorial is a starting point for my main game. Since finishing the tutorial I have been creating a timer on my own using documentation and tweaking some things from the tutorial.
