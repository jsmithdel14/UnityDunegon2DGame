# Unity2D_DunegonGame

I started to write a game that is in Unity, where you are playing as someone stuck in a castle, the end goal of this game is to make it out of the castle alive or die trying. I want the game to be a survival game where it gets increasinly more difficult the longer the game goes on and the longer you are stuck in the castle. 

The basic controls are wasd for player movement. In the future you will be able to click the mouse to swing your weapon, that feature is the next part of my project. The player can also currently interact with a chest by walking on it to get gold from the chest. The gold the player has earned is saved through a save state everytime the player goes to another level. There is a camera script that controls what the camera will do. The camera is set to only follow the player around as the player moves through the castle, it is a locked camera.

The goal of writing this software was to improve my understanding of working with objects and inheritance. I also thought that a fun way to learn more about it was to learn Unity something I have not previously used before. Making a game that I enjoy has made learning a better experience than it would have been otherwise and that is why I want to finish the game, this is only the intial part of my game software. For this intial base game or software I had to learn Unity and the Unity libraries for C# so I found a video demo I have been following that shows all the basics of Unity and C#. My goal is to learn as much as I can from the tutorial and step away from the tutorial to make the true survival game that I want to make, the tutorial is a starting point for my main game. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
